# Computer Vision ASL Interpreter

## Overview

Computer Vision ASL Interpreter is a real-time hand sign recognition system designed to interpret American Sign Language (ASL). The system recognizes up to 26 unique symbols from a live camera feed and has applications in facilitating communication between the deaf community and people unfamiliar with ASL. The project was built using Python and leveraged technologies such as OpenCV, MediaPipe, Keras, and Teachable Machine.

## Features

- **Real-time ASL Recognition:** The system captures the hand signs from a live camera feed and interprets them into corresponding symbols of the American Sign Language.

- **Model Training:** Trained with 300 images for each symbol, utilizing the Keras library to create a robust and efficient machine learning model.

- **High Accuracy:** Achieved an impressive overall translation accuracy of 91% through rigorous testing with various angles and symbols.

- **Overlay Translation:** The system employs MediaPipe to overlay real-time translation above the hand signs on the display for a proper conversation.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Computer Vision Library:** OpenCV
- **Machine Learning Frameworks:** TensorFlow, Keras
- **Real-time Translation Overlay:** MediaPipe
- **Model Training Platform:** Teachable Machine
